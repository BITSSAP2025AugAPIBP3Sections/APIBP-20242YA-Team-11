## 1. Product Overview

OpenShop is a robust, API-driven e-commerce backend designed to facilitate seamless interaction between buyers and sellers. Built as a monolithic application for streamlined deployment, it provides a unified interface for catalog management, shopping cart operations, and order processing. The project demonstrates a hybrid API implementation, utilizing REST for transactional resources (Users, Orders, Cart) and GraphQL for flexible, high-volume data fetching (Product Catalog).

---

## 2. API-First Approach

We adopted an API-first approach by designing the OpenAPI (Swagger) and GraphQL schema before implementation. This allowed us to:

- **Stakeholder Analysis**: We first identified the core needs of Customers (browsing, buying) and Sellers (inventory management).
- **Schema Definition**: Before writing any Java code, we defined the interface contracts. We used OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) to model REST resources and defined a GraphQL Schema (SDL) for the product catalog.
- **Mocking & Validation**: These schemas allowed us to validate the data flow and business logic requirements (Scope In/Out) before implementation, ensuring the endpoints met the requirements of our stakeholders.

---

## 3. Stakeholders

- 👤 **Customer**: Authenticated users who browse the catalog, manage their shopping cart, and checkout orders.
- 🛒 **Seller**: Users with elevated permissions responsible for creating products, managing inventory, and updating order statuses.

## 4. Core Functionalities

🔑 Multi-role Support: Customer and Seller roles with granular permissions  
🔐 User Authentication & Registration (JWT)  
🛍️ Product Catalog: Full CRUD operations with GraphQL query support  
🛒 Shopping Cart: Add, remove, update quantities, checkout  
📦 Inventory Management: Real-time stock tracking and reservation  
💳 Payment Integration: Mock payment gateway with success/failure simulation  
🗄️ Database Persistence: PostgreSQL  
⚠️ Exception Handling  
✅ Validations
🚦 Rate Limiting: Protects APIs from excessive requests  
🏷️ API Versioning: All REST endpoints are versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`)

---

## 5. Scope In

👥 **Customer and Seller flows**: Registration, login, product management, cart, order, inventory, and mocked payment

## 8. Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to set up the database and start the application locally:

### 📝 Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openshop.git
cd svc/openshop/src/main/java/com/openshop/
```

### 🐳 Step 2: Start PostgreSQL Container

Run the following command to pull the PostgreSQL image and start it in a Docker container. This maps port 5432 on your machine to the container.

```bash
docker run --name openshop-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:15
```

### 🛠️ Step 3: Configure the Database

Now, access the running container to create the specific database and user for the application.

1. **Enter the PostgreSQL interactive terminal:**

```bash
docker exec -it openshop-postgres psql -U postgres
```

2. **Run the following SQL commands inside the terminal:** (Copy and paste these commands one by one or as a block)

```sql
-- Create the application database
CREATE DATABASE openshopdb;

-- Create the application user
CREATE USER openshop WITH PASSWORD 'openshop123';

-- Grant privileges to the user on the database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE openshopdb TO openshop;

-- Switch to the new database
\c openshopdb

-- Grant schema privileges
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO openshop;

-- Ensure future tables are accessible to the user
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO openshop;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES TO openshop;
```

3. **Exit the terminal:** Type `\q` or press `Ctrl + D`.

### 🚦 Step 4: Run the Application

Navigate to your project root directory (where the `pom.xml` file is located) and run the application using Maven.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 🔗 Step 5: Verify Access

Once the application starts successfully, you can access it at:

- **Base URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:8080/api/... (e.g., /api/auth/login)
